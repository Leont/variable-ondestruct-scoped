# ABSTRACT: Call a subroutine on destruction of a variable.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Variable::OnDestruct::Scoped;

 my @handle = on_destruct $var, sub { do_something() };
 push @handle, on_destruct @array, sub { do_something_else() };
 push @handle, on_destruct %array, sub { hashes_work_too() };
 push @handle, on_destruct &$sub, sub { so_do_closures($but_not_normal_subs) };
 push @handle, on_destruct *$glob, sub { and_even_globs($similar_caveats_as_subs_though) };
 
 @handle = () if $want_to_cancel_destructor;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to let a function be called when a variable gets destroyed. The destructor will work not only on scalars but also on arrays, hashes, subs and globs. For the latter two you should realize that most of them aren't scoped like normal variables. Subs for example will only work like you expect them to when they are closures (otherwise they're immortal).

=func on_destruct $variable, \&sub;

This function adds a destructor callback to a variable. This callback will be called when the variable is destroyed, but only if the canary it returns is still alive (meaning it's stored somewhere). If the canary is destructed first the callback will not be called. This function is exported by default.
